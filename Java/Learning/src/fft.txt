To convert sound to frequency in Java, you can use Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT) algorithm¹. The first step is to read the audio file and convert it 
into an array of samples³. Then you can apply FFT to this array of samples 
to get the frequency domain representation of the audio signal¹. You can 
then calculate the frequency in Hz by finding the index of the maximum 
value in the FFT output array and multiplying it by the sampling rate 
divided by the length of the array¹. Finally, you can write this frequency 
value to a file³.

I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions!
